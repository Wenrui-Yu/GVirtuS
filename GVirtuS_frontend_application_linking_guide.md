# GVirtuS Frontend Application Linking Guide

This guide walks through how to properly set up and verify GVirtuS integration with your CUDA frontend application. It ensures that fake CUDA libraries provided by GVirtuS are correctly linked and used during compilation and execution.

---

## üîß Step 1: Locate GVirtuS Installation

Before compiling any frontend application with GVirtuS, locate the directory where GVirtuS is installed. Typically, this includes subdirectories like `lib/`, `lib/frontend/`, `plugins/`, and `etc/`.

Example installation path:

```

/home/GVirtuS/

````

Set this path as your GVIRTUS_HOME:

```bash
export GVIRTUS_HOME=/home/GVirtuS
````

---

## üìÇ Step 2: Verify Frontend Library Path

GVirtuS uses fake CUDA libraries in its `lib/frontend/` folder to intercept CUDA calls. Ensure the path exists:

```bash
ls ${GVIRTUS_HOME}/lib/frontend
```

Expected output (partial):

```
libcudart.so
libcudart.so.12
libcudnn.so
libcudnn.so.9
libcublas.so
libcublas.so.12
libcusolver.so
libnvrtc.so
...
```

If these files exist, you're ready to continue.

---

## üß¨ Step 3: Set Library Path Environment Variable

Update your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include GVirtuS libraries:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${GVIRTUS_HOME}/lib:${GVIRTUS_HOME}/lib/frontend:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
```

Verify:

```bash
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Example output:

```
/home/GVirtuS/lib:/home/GVirtuS/lib/frontend:/usr/local/nvidia/lib:/usr/local/nvidia/lib64
```

This confirms the GVirtuS paths are injected.

---

## üß™ Step 4: Compile a CUDA Application

Compile your CUDA frontend application using `nvcc`, and explicitly link CUDA libraries that GVirtuS fakes:

```bash
nvcc cnn.cu -o example -L -lcuda -lcudnn --cudart=shared
```

This command links against:

* `cuda`
* `cudnn`
* `cudart`

---

## üîç Step 5: Verify Dynamic Linking

After compilation, use `ldd` to inspect which libraries your binary is linked to:

```bash
ldd ./example
```

Example output:

```
libcudart.so.12 => /home/GVirtuS/lib/frontend/libcudart.so.12
libgvirtus-frontend.so => /home/GVirtuS/lib/libgvirtus-frontend.so
libgvirtus-communicators.so => /home/GVirtuS/lib/libgvirtus-communicators.so
...
```

Make sure paths are resolving to **`GVIRTUS_HOME/lib/frontend/`** ‚Äî this confirms the binary is using GVirtuS to intercept CUDA calls.

---

## üöÄ Step 6: Run the Binary

Run your compiled binary:

```bash
./example
```

If everything is set up correctly, the application will:

* Load GVirtuS frontend
* Redirect CUDA calls to the backend system

---

## ‚ùó Troubleshooting: Connection Errors

If you see an error like:

```
INFO - GVirtuS frontend version /home/GVirtuS/etc/properties.json
ERROR - "Frontend.cpp":122: Exception occurred: TcpCommunicator: Can't connect to socket: Connection refused.
```

This means:

* GVirtuS frontend can't reach the backend server over the network.

**Solution:**

1. Open `${GVIRTUS_HOME}/etc/properties.json`
2. Set the correct IP address or hostname of your backend machine
3. Restart the application

Example JSON snippet:

```json
{
  "communicator": {
    "type": "tcp",
    "host": "192.168.1.10",
    "port": 8888
  }
}
```

## üìò GVirtuS Frontend‚ÄìBackend Communication Failure while using docker containers

However, in some cases, the direct solution above may not work ‚Äî particularly when using two separate containers with misconfigured networking. To address this, I‚Äôve outlined a more detailed approach for debugging frontend‚Äìbackend communication issues.

---

### üß© Problem

When running the **frontend container**, the following error occurred:

```bash
ERROR - "Frontend.cpp":122: Exception occurred: TcpCommunicator: Can't connect to socket: Connection refused.
```

This indicates that the GVirtuS frontend cannot reach the backend process via the specified TCP socket.

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

### ‚ùì **What was expected:**

The frontend container should connect to the GVirtuS backend at:

```
tcp://192.168.0.124:8888
```

as configured in `etc/properties.json`.

### ‚ùó **What actually happened:**

* Frontend threw a connection error.
* `nc -zv 192.168.0.124 8888` from the frontend returned:
  `Connection refused`
* `docker inspect` showed **no published port mapping**.
* Backend was listening inside its container but **not exposed externally**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Process

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Verify Backend Listening

Inside the backend container:

```bash
ss -tuln | grep 8888
```

Output:

```
tcp LISTEN 0 5 0.0.0.0:8888 0.0.0.0:*
```

‚úÖ This confirms the backend process is listening ‚Äî but only **inside the container**.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Test From Frontend

Inside frontend container:

```bash
nc -zv 192.168.0.124 8888
```

Result:

```
nc: connect to 192.168.0.124 port 8888 (tcp) failed: Connection refused
```

‚ùå Indicates port is **not accessible** externally.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Fix Port Accessibility

#### ‚úÖ Option Chosen: Use Host Networking

We restarted the **backend container** using:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --gpus all \
  --network host \          # üëà This is the fix
  --name gvirtus-backend \
  gvirtus-backend-image
```

‚úÖ This allows the container to **share the host network stack**, making it reachable at `192.168.0.124:8888`.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You could also use `-p 8888:8888` as an alternative fix.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Confirm It Works

Back inside frontend container:

```bash
nc -zv 192.168.0.124 8888
```

‚úÖ Output:

```
Connection to 192.168.0.124 8888 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
```

After applying this solution, I was able to successfully establish communication between the GVirtuS frontend application and the GVirtuS backend across two separate Docker containers over the network.
