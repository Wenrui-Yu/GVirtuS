# üìÑ NVIDIA Driver & CUDA Compatibility for GVirtuS (Docker-Based)

## ‚úÖ Summary

This document outlines compatibility between CUDA 12.6 Docker images, host NVIDIA drivers, and Ubuntu versions ‚Äî particularly in the context of running **GVirtuS** within a Docker environment.

---

## üîß Key Compatibility Observations

### 1. **CUDA 12.6 Docker Image on NVIDIA Driver 570** (or 560+ onwards as recommended at at the main Readme)

* ‚úÖ Works **perfectly** on hosts with **NVIDIA driver 570**.
* ‚úÖ Even if the host has a **different CUDA version installed (e.g., 11.5)**, the Docker container will work fine.
* ‚úÖ This setup is suitable for running GVirtuS with modern CUDA workloads.

> üìù **Why it works:** NVIDIA driver 570 supports CUDA 12.6 at the kernel level, which is sufficient for containerized workloads.

---

### 2. **CUDA 12.6 Docker Image on NVIDIA Driver 535**

* ‚ùå **Fails to run**, even if the host has **CUDA 12.2 installed**.
* ‚ùå `nvidia-container-cli` will throw a compatibility error:
  `unsatisfied condition: cuda>=12.6`

> üõë **Why it fails:** NVIDIA driver 535 **does not support CUDA 12.6**, and containers require driver support at runtime.

---

### 3. **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Driver Support**

* ‚úÖ Fully supports **NVIDIA driver 535**.
* ‚ùå Does **not officially support NVIDIA driver 570** ‚Äî manual installation may break DKMS, kernel modules, or require kernel upgrades.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Recommendation:** Avoid using NVIDIA 570 with Ubuntu 20.04 in production.

---

### 4. **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Driver Support**

* ‚úÖ Fully supports **NVIDIA driver 570** and newer.
* ‚úÖ Compatible with **CUDA 12.6 Docker images**.
* ‚úÖ Recommended base system for **GVirtuS + Docker + CUDA 12.6** environments.

## üì¶ GVirtuS Docker Compatibility

In our **GVirtuS system**, we rely on:

* **CUDA 12.6 Docker image**
* **NVIDIA driver 570**
* **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS host system**

This combination ensures:

* ‚úÖ Full support for GPU acceleration in containers
* ‚úÖ Compatibility with CUDA and cuDNN via GVirtuS
* ‚úÖ Stability for deep learning and virtualized GPU workloads

## ‚úÖ Recommended Setup for GVirtuS

| Component        | Version/Recommendation                    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Ubuntu Host      | 22.04 LTS                                 |
| NVIDIA Driver    | 570                                       |
| Docker Image     | CUDA 12.6 (e.g., `nvidia/cuda:12.6-base`) |
| GVirtuS Frontend | Compatible with CUDA 12.6                 |
